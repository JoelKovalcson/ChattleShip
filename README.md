# ChattleShip

## Introduction

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://chattleship.herokuapp.com/).

This project was designed for a group to come up with an original application using a few specified technologies.

Additional requirements for the project were as follows:
* Node + Express backend
* MySQL database accessed through Sequelize as an ORM
* Must protect environment variables
* Use `express-session` and cookies for user authentication
* Use another library, package, or technology not covered in class

## Description

Chattleship is an online game inspired by the classic game Battleship. The current game supports a few features such as:
- Chatting with your enemy in a game
- Board setup and previewing when creating/joining a game
- Persistent game sessions so you can pickup a game where you left off
- No more lying friends about missing at C5
